                    <h3>Profile</h3>
                    <p>My name is Matthew Corin. I am a qualified Mechanical Engineer from the University of Pretoria looking to make a career change into the tech industry.
                        I am a passionate person and am keenly interested in coding, sport and the outdoors!
                        <br><br>
                        My passion for technology was kickstarted during my studies, where I was first exposed to coding and it's capabilities. Throughout my life, I have also 
                        developed strong teamwork and communication skills. I have also had a year's working experience which has improved these skills and provided me with valuable life experience as well.
                        My background, willingness to learn and improve and the skills I have acquired along the way are attributes which I believe make me an exemplary employee.

                            My role involved understanding the products manufactured and sold by Milkor, a defence company established in 1981. 
                            This understanding was then implemented in a business context, with the majority of my work consisting of building relationships with 
                            pre-existing clients, meeting and presenting for potential new clients and managing the marketing of these products throughout the various 
                            international regions that the company sold to.

                                This 6-month contract was my first exposure to the workplace after my studies and my job included learning about the processes of steel pipe manufacturing. 
                                Initially, I was tasked with assisting on the production line of the Electric Resistance Weld (ERW) Mill in the plant, before moving into the Automation and Maintenance team, where
                                I assisted with engineering drawing, ordering parts and fault-finding processes.

                        Two modules included in the BEng Mechanical Engineering degree required 6 weeks each of vacation work. To complete these modules, I worked at PBS Machine Tools for 3 weeks between Jun and July 2017, 
                        the Artisan Training Institute for 6 weeks between December 2018 and January 2019 and finally, Weir Minerals for a further 3 weeks between Jun and July 2019. These modules had certain requirements that were to be met, 
                        mainly regarding the Occupational Helath and Safety Act and being exposed to a realistic, working, engineering environment. Each of the two modules also required a report to be written and compiled to indicate what the role 
                        entailed and how the requirements were met.
